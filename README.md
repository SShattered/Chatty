# Chatty

There's no much insight about this project. My goal was to build a chat app that users are anonymous and paired to chat randomly :)

Used .net maui here for the front-end

## What's working?
* Chat is working, barely. Users can chat with each other

## ToDo
* Improve the user pairing and related things on the server
* More work on frontend app
